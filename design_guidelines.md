# Design Guidelines: Not Applicable

## Project Classification
This is a **security infrastructure and tooling repository** with no frontend interface or visual components.

## Scope
The project consists entirely of:
- Configuration files (YAML, JSON)
- Security middleware (code utilities)
- Documentation (Markdown)
- CI/CD workflows
- Git hooks

## Design Requirements
**None.** This repository contains:
- No web pages or user interfaces
- No visual components
- No layout requirements
- No color schemes or typography needs

The deliverables are purely functional security configurations and documentation that will be consumed by developers and automated systems, not end users.

**Note to Engineer:** Focus on clear code comments, well-structured configuration files, and comprehensive documentation formatting (Markdown). No visual design implementation is needed.
