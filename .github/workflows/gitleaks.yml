            Gitleaks has detected potential secrets in this pull request.
            
            **Action Required:**
            1. Review the Gitleaks scan results in the Actions tab
            2. Remove any hardcoded secrets from your code
            3. If these are false positives, add them to \`.gitleaks.toml\` allowlist
            4. Use environment variables or a secrets manager instead
